About the Re-Pong! application
The first, and last, pong revision you'll ever want to play. The application was developed by Austin Cohrs, Isaac Heist, Kimmer O'Reilly, and Chris Stefan.

Purpose
Re-Pong! is a new version of the old Pong game.  The source code for this game was derived from (and inspired by) the pong version conceived by <button><a href="http://blog.mailson.org/2013/02/simple-pong-game-using-html5-and-canvas/#read-more" target="_blank">Mailson Daniel Lira Menezes.</a></button>

How to Use the Application and the expected results.
The object of the game is for the two players to "hit" the ball back and forth in an attempt to make the other player miss.  Each miss results in a point awarded to the player who last hits the ball.  The game ends when the winner is awarded a ninth point.

To begin the game, a user (or users) navigates to the Re-Pong! website and enters a name for Player One and Player Two. The user then clicks on "Play".  Player One moves their paddle up and down using the up and down arrows, respectively, on the keyboard.  Player Two moves their paddle up and down with the "W" and "S" keys, respectively.

After the game ends, the user clicks on the Leaderboard link in the top right-hand corner of the main game page to see their player card which consists of player cards detailing each player's wins, losses, total matches played, win ratio (wins divided by total matches played), the nemesis (the player outside of the card who has defeated the player most), and a button for the player's complete match history.  Each match history has the opponent's name, the match score, and how many points each player scored in the match.
